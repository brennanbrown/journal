Welcome to my new blog, where I'm rediscovering myself, chasing my dreams, and writing down observations and insights in order to document and capture my experiences.

My name is Kenneth, and this a continuation of my life's journey - both physical, mental, and spiritual. It's a journey of discovery and learning, of understanding and of being. I'm currently in my third year as an undergrad at Mount Royal University studying English.

This blog is largely about my exploration of creativity and its power to urge us to reflect on ourselves. In it, I will wax poetic about the joys and sorrows of everyday life, document my experiences as a student, share my creative writing endeavors, and update readers on my health, fitness, and well-being.

I have found evidence of beauty in the mundane, that the 'small stuff' can often be the most significant, and so I invite all of you to join me in this journey of ongoing self-discovery.

Thanks for being here!
